                <p>
                    My name is Tj Kalau, 18 years old and I am a 3rd year student software developer. I am a student who is driven for more, who is interested in new things and also open for improvement. My preference is mainly with the front-end, coming up with layouts, styling pages and designing new functions are things that suit me very well. I am also functional on the back-end. 
                    This is just not up to standard as my front-end. But I am always open for feedback and improvement.

                        HTML and CSS are the first languages I learned. These are also the languages I control the most. Styling the HTML elements with CSS is something I love to do as you can go either way. Currently I am still working with HTML and CSS and learning new things every time.

                        JavaScript is a language I learned to master the 3 front-end languages. I think it's a nice language because you can improve the interaction with the front-end a lot. During my internship I worked with a JavaScript framework called: Angular. This worked well and I was able to gain more experience.

                    <p>
                        PHP is a language that I can use for both the front-end and the back-end. Here I can retrieve data from databases and also send entered data from users. I think this is a nice language to work with as the possibilities are quite wide.

                        I've been playing football since I was 7. I did this for 10 years and then took a 2 year break. After 2 years the passion for football started to take over again and I started playing football again. I am currently playing football at one of the local clubs in Roosendaal.
